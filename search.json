In this chapter, we cover the course requirements and some tips on how you should change your RStudio settings.\nIf you haven’t installed R yet, do so now by getting the newest version from CRAN. If you do have R installed, check your Version of R by opening RStudio and typing the following command into the console.\nR.version.string\n\n[1] \"R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)\"\nThis returns the version number of your R installation, whereas the first digit (4) indicates the number of the major release, the second digit (3) indicates the minor release and the last digit (3) refers to the patch release. As a general rule of thumb, you will want to update R if you\nIn the time of writing (February, 2025), the current R Version is 4.4.2 (released on 31.10.2024, see cran.r-project.org). Your installation should therefore not be older than 4.3.0.\nIf your current installation is older, make sure that you have updated R before the course. Check these instructions on how to update R",

There are two ways for you to generate your own trajectory data.\nPlease let us know which option you choose by filling out the following survey on Moodle.\nBy using a tracking app, your phone will collect your movement data automatically. There are different types of tracking apps, from tracking specific activities to passivly tracking 24 hours. Here is a not conclusive list of tracking tools you could use. But fill free to use your own tracking tool if you are already using one:\nPlease check after a view days if the tracking is working properly.
