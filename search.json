    "text": "Download this Demoscript via “&lt;/&gt;Code” (top right)\nDepending on your knowledge of R, getting an overview of the data we imported last week might have been quite a challenge. Surprisingly enough, importing, cleaning and exploring your data can be the most challenging, time consuming part of a project. RStudio and the tidyverse offer many helpful tools to make this part easier (and more fun). You have read chapters on dplyr and magrittr as a preparation for this exercise. Before we start with the exercise however, this demo illustrates a simple approach offered by tidyverse which is applicable to sf-objects.\nAssume we want to calculate the timelag between subsequent positions. To achieve this we can use the function difftime() combined with lead() from dplyr. Let’s look at these functions one by one.\n\ndifftime\ndifftime takes two POSIXct values.\n\nnow &lt;- as.POSIXct(\"2024-04-26 10:20:00\")\nlater &lt;- as.POSIXct(\"2024-04-26 11:35:00\")\n\nlater &lt;- now + 10000\n\nlater\n\n[1] \"2024-04-26 13:06:40 CEST\"\n\ntime_difference &lt;- difftime(later, now)\n\ntime_difference\n\nTime difference of 2.777778 hours\n\n\nYou can also specify the unit of the output.\n\ntime_difference &lt;- difftime(later, now, units = \"secs\")\n\ntime_difference\n\nTime difference of 10000 secs\n\n\ndifftime returns an object of the class difftime.\n\nclass(time_difference)\n## [1] \"difftime\"\n\nstr(time_difference)\n##  'difftime' num 10000\n##  - attr(*, \"units\")= chr \"secs\"\n\nHowever in our case, numeric values would be more handy than the class difftime. So we’ll wrap the command in as.numeric():\n\ntime_difference &lt;- as.numeric(difftime(later, now, units = \"secs\"))\n\nstr(time_difference)\n##  num 10000\nclass(time_difference)\n## [1] \"numeric\"\n\nIn fact, we will use this exact operation multiple times, so let’s create a function for this:\n\ndifftime_secs &lt;- function(later, now){\n    as.numeric(difftime(later, now, units = \"secs\"))\n}\n\n\n\nlead() / lag()\nlead() and lag() return a vector of the same length as the input, just offset by a specific number of values (default is 1). Consider the following sequence:\n\nnumbers &lt;- 1:10\n\nnumbers\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nWe can now run lead() and lag() on this sequence to illustrate the output. n = specifies the offset, default = specifies the default value used to “fill” the emerging “empty spaces” of the vector. This helps us performing operations on subsequent values in a vector (or rows in a table).\n\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\nlead(numbers)\n\n [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 NA\n\nlead(numbers, n = 2)\n\n [1]  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 NA NA\n\nlag(numbers)\n\n [1] NA  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n\nlag(numbers, n = 5)\n\n [1] NA NA NA NA NA  1  2  3  4  5\n\nlag(numbers, n = 5, default = 0)\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\nmutate()\nUsing the above functions (difftime() and lead()), we can calculate the time lag, that is, the time difference between consecutive positions. We will try this on a dummy version of our wild boar dataset.\n\nwildschwein &lt;- tibble(\n    TierID = c(rep(\"Hans\", 5), rep(\"Klara\", 5)),\n    DatetimeUTC = rep(as.POSIXct(\"2015-01-01 00:00:00\", tz = \"UTC\") + 0:4 * 15 * 60, 2)\n)\n\nwildschwein\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   TierID DatetimeUTC        \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;             \n 1 Hans   2015-01-01 00:00:00\n 2 Hans   2015-01-01 00:15:00\n 3 Hans   2015-01-01 00:30:00\n 4 Hans   2015-01-01 00:45:00\n 5 Hans   2015-01-01 01:00:00\n 6 Klara  2015-01-01 00:00:00\n 7 Klara  2015-01-01 00:15:00\n 8 Klara  2015-01-01 00:30:00\n 9 Klara  2015-01-01 00:45:00\n10 Klara  2015-01-01 01:00:00\n\n\nIf we are interested to calculate the speed travelled between subsequent locations, we need to calculate the elapsed time first.

You can calculate the time difference using the function difftime_secs() (see below) in combination with lead() (see lead() / lag()). Store the time difference in a new column (e.g. timelag).\n\ndifftime_secs &lt;- function(later, now){\n    as.numeric(difftime(later, now, units = \"secs\"))\n}\n\nNow inspect your data in more detail. Try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many individuals were tracked?\nFor how long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?\nWere all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially?\nWhat is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nsummarise() tries to coerce all (Point-) geometries into one object, which can take along time. To avoid this, use st_drop_geometry() before using summarise().\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Distance between locations\nSimilar to how we calculated the timelag between subsequent locations, we can calculate the distance like so:\n\nlater &lt;- lag(wildschwein_BE$geometry)\nnow &lt;- wildschwein_BE$geometry\n\nst_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)  # by_element must be set to TRUE\n\nHowever, similar to difftime(), the output has a unit which complicates things. Therefore, it’s simpler to wrap the output in as.numeric(). Let’s make a function for this process:\n\ndistance_by_element &lt;- function(later, now){\n  as.numeric(\n    st_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)\n  )\n}\n\nUse this function to create a new column named steplength with the distance between locations.\n\n\nTask 4: Deriving distance & speed\nIn this task we will derive some additional movement parameters from our trajectories. So far our trajectories only consist of a list of time-stamped spatial locations. First let’s calculate the Euclidean distance between subsequent locations using the function st_distance() with the option by_element = TRUE. Store these values in a new column with the name steplength. Next, you can calculate the animals’ speed based on steplength and the timelag (from the last task).\n\n\nTask 5: Plausibility Check\nIt’s important to repeatedly visualize our results, to make sure these are plausible. This is much simpler if we just look at a small sample of our dataset. We can use head(100) to extract the first 100 rows.\n\nwildschwein_sample &lt;- wildschwein_BE |&gt;\n  filter(TierName == \"Sabi\") |&gt; \n  head(100)\n\nWe can now visualise the sample using tmap with the *view” mode:\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tmap)\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntm_shape(wildschwein_sample) + \n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: By clicking on the dots, we can see what parameters are associated with each sample.\n\n\n\nThe wild boar move continuously through space, but our samples are discrete points. It would be helpful to at least see the sequence of these samples. We can do this by casting our points to lines. However, we first need to dissolve our single points into a MULTIPOINT object, just like we had to do in the first week when we calculated the minimum convex polygon per animal (see Input: Calculate Convex Hull). The option do_union = FALSE is a confusing way to preserve the order of the points, see Nils’ question on GitHub.\nIn addition, we can set OpenStreetMap to be the default basemap, since it’s available at lower zoom levels.\n\n\n\n\nwildschwein_sample_line &lt;- wildschwein_sample |&gt; \n  # dissolve to a MULTIPOINT:\n  summarise(do_union = FALSE) |&gt; \n  st_cast(\"LINESTRING\")\n\ntmap_options(basemaps = \"OpenStreetMap\")\n\ntm_shape(wildschwein_sample_line) +\n  tm_lines() +\n  tm_shape(wildschwein_sample) + \n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: The interconnecting lines help us understand the animal’s movement trajectory.",

    "text": "In preparation, you’ve read the paper by Laube and Purves (2011). In this paper, the authors analyse speed at different scales and compare these different values. Let’s conceptually reconstruct one of the experiments the authors conducted.\nFigure 8.1 shows how speed was calculated in the first of three scales. Do you notice how their method differs to how we calculated speed? We calculation the speed for a specific sample to be the distance travelled to the next sample devided by the according time difference. Laube and Purves (2011) use the distance travelled from the previous sample to the next sample (and the according time difference).\nTo reproduce this experiment, we will use a new wild boar dataset with following characteristics:\n\nSmall number of samples (200 locations)\nOnly one individual (caro)\nA constant sampling interval (60s)\n\nThis last aspect is important, since we would otherwise have to deal with varying sampling intervals, which would greatly complicate things. Download this dataset here: caro60.csv. Import it just like you imported the other wild boar data and save it to a new variable named caro (note that the locations are stored in EPSG 2056).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Black points are used in calculation of speed, from Laube and Purves (2011)\n\n\n\nWe will need the following to functions from Exercise A:\n\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\ndifftime_secs &lt;- function(x, y){\n  as.numeric(difftime(x, y, units = \"secs\"))\n}\n\ndistance_by_element &lt;- function(later, now){\n  as.numeric(\n    st_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)\n  )\n}\n\nWe can then import the data. We can discard all columns with the exception of DatetimeUTC with select (see below).\n\ncaro &lt;- read_delim(\"datasets/caro60.csv\", \",\") |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"E\",\"N\"), crs = 2056) |&gt; \n  select(DatetimeUTC)\n\n\nTask 1: Calculate speed at scale 1\nIn our first scale, we will assume a sampling window \\(w\\) of 120 seconds. This conveniently means that for every location, you can use the previous and next location to calculate speed.

In this task, try to implement \\(w = 240s\\) (see Figure 8.2), which means using an offset of 2.\n\nTip: Use the n = parameter in lead/lag to increase the offset.\nStore values timelag, steplength and speed in the columns timelag2, steplength2 and speed2 to distinguish them from the values from scale 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Calculate speed at scale 2 with a sampling window \\(w_2\\) (from Laube and Purves 2011)\n\n\n\nAfter completing the task, your dataset should look like this:\n\ncaro |&gt; \n  # drop geometry and select only specific columns\n  # to display relevant data only\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  select(timelag2, steplength2, speed2) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  timelag2 steplength2 speed2\n     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       NA        NA   NA    \n2       NA        NA   NA    \n3      240        96.5  0.402\n4      240        90.8  0.378\n5      240        59.6  0.248\n6      240        37.3  0.155\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Calculate speed at scale 3\nRedo the previous task with \\(w = 480s\\) (offset of 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Calculate speed at scale 3 with a sampling window \\(w_3\\) (from Laube and Purves 2011)\n\n\n\nAfter completing the task, your dataset should look like this:\n\ncaro |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  select(timelag3, steplength3, speed3) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  timelag3 steplength3 speed3\n     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       NA        NA   NA    \n2       NA        NA   NA    \n3       NA        NA   NA    \n4       NA        NA   NA    \n5      480       102.   0.214\n6      480        82.5  0.172\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Compare speed across scales\nWe now have a dataframe with three different speed values per sample, corresponding to the different scales / sampling windows (\\(w_1 = 120s\\), \\(w_2 = 240s\\) and \\(w_3=480s\\)). It would now be interesting to compare these measurements and see our results correspond to those of Laube and Purves (2011). In their experiments, the authors observe:\n\n\nA steady decrease in median speed as the temporal analysis scale increases;\nA decrease in the overall variance in speed as the temporal scale increases;\nLower minimum values at the shortest temporal scales;\n\n\nThe authors visualize these observations using box plots. To to the same, we need to process our data slightly. Currently, our data looks like this:\n\ncaro |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  select(DatetimeUTC, speed, speed2, speed3)\n\n# A tibble: 200 × 4\n   DatetimeUTC          speed speed2  speed3\n   &lt;dttm&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2015-09-15 08:07:00 NA     NA     NA     \n 2 2015-09-15 08:08:00  0.437 NA     NA     \n 3 2015-09-15 08:09:00  0.487  0.402 NA     \n 4 2015-09-15 08:10:00  0.410  0.378 NA     \n 5 2015-09-15 08:11:00  0.272  0.248  0.214 \n 6 2015-09-15 08:12:00  0.150  0.155  0.172 \n 7 2015-09-15 08:13:00  0.195  0.140  0.0868\n 8 2015-09-15 08:14:00  0.206  0.124  0.0652\n 9 2015-09-15 08:15:00  0.104  0.146  0.0795\n10 2015-09-15 08:16:00  0.101  0.109  0.0848\n# ℹ 190 more rows\n\n\nWe can make a box plot of a single column using ggplot2:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(caro, aes(y = speed)) + \n    # we remove outliers to increase legibility, analogue\n  # Laube and Purves (2011)\n  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if we want to compare speed with speed2 and speed3, we need need a long table rather than wide one (which is what we currently have).

This will create a RStudio Project without Git version control (and consequently without a Github connection). This is a typical situation for a project that you started without version control in mind. Choose the following settings:\n\nDirectory name: Choose a directory name that suits your structure\nCreate project as a subdirectory of: Choose a parent directory that suits your folder structure\nCreate a git repository: not checked (we will do this manually in the next step)\nUse renv with this project: not checked\n\n\n\nStep 2: Activate Git Version Control\nActivating Git Version Control for your project is one line of code. In your shell terminal, type the following command:\n# explicitly specify the branch name to be \"main\",\n# this leads to less confusion later on\ngit init -b main\nYou should get a message, saying Initialized empty Git repository in C:/path/to/your/directory/.git/. You will see this folder (named .git) in your project’s root directory (check your “Files” pane ). If you don’t see it there, click Refresh file listing (refresh symbol to the very right of the files pane). If you still don’t see it, make hidden files visible (Files pane &gt; More &gt; Show hidden files)\nTo see the “Git” Pane in RStudio, reload RStudio either by restarting it or clicking on the name of your RStudio project in the top right corner of RStudio and selecting your project from the project list).\n\n\nStep 3: Create a Github Repository\nNow create a Github Repository following the instructions from last week. This time however, don’t check Add a README file.\nCopy the https URL to your Github repo, which should look something like this: https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/cma-week4.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nReport the URL of your new repo back to us via Moodle!\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Connect to Github\nTo connect your (local) RStudio Project to Github, we have to set up our Github repo to be our so called “remote” repository. We could have multiple remotes, which is why we need to name it, and the convention is to call it origin. To create a remote named origin, type the following command in your shell terminal:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/cma-week4.git\nNow, before you can push anything to the remote repository, you need to commit something first. Last week, you used the Git Pane from RStudio to commit your files. Since we are already in the terminal, let’s use the terminal for this and in this way get to know git a little bit better.\nThere is one little that we glanced over till now. Before committing a file, you selected them first. This process is called adding to the staging area. To add your cma-week4.Rproj to your git repo, type the following command:\n# Adjust the filename accordingly\ngit add cma-week4.Rproj\nTo commit this file, type the following command\n# The text after -m is your commit message\ngit commit -m \"my initial commit\"\nThe first time we push to this remote repository, we need to specify the an upstream, so that future git push will be directed to the correct remote branch. We can to this with the --set-upstream (or -u)\nAssuming your branch is called main, type the following command. You can check the name of your branch with command git branch (the default branch name is either main or master).\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nThis command prints a couple of messages, ending with the following statement: Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.. Now that the upstream (i.e.) tracking branch is correctly set up, you can also push via the Git pane in RStudio (you might need to refresh the Git pane first).",

Transform the data into an sf object, filter for the wildboar Sabi and a datetime between “2015-07-01” and “2015-07-03”.\n\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\n\nwildschwein &lt;- read_delim(\"datasets/wildschwein_BE_2056.csv\", \",\")\n\n# Careful!

The circle highlights possible ‘static points’\n\n\n\n\n\nStep a): Specify a temporal window \\(v\\)\nIn the above dataset, the sampling interval is 15 minutes. If we take a temporal window of 60 minutes, that would mean including 4 fixes. We need to calculate the following Euclidean distances (pos representing single location):\n\npos[n-2] to pos[n]\npos[n-1] to pos[n]\npos[n] to pos[n+1]\npos[n] to pos[n+2]\n\n\n\nStep b): Measure the distance from every point to every other point within this temporal window \\(v\\)\nWe can use the function distance_by_element from week 2 in combination with lead() and lag() to calculate the Euclidean distance. For example, to create the necessary offset of n-2, we use lag(x, 2). For each offset, we create one individual column.\n\ndistance_by_element &lt;- function(later, now) {\n  as.numeric(\n    st_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)\n  )\n}\n\nsabi &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        nMinus2 = distance_by_element(lag(geometry, 2), geometry),  # distance to pos -30 minutes\n        nMinus1 = distance_by_element(lag(geometry, 1), geometry),  # distance to pos -15 minutes\n        nPlus1  = distance_by_element(geometry, lead(geometry, 1)), # distance to pos +15 mintues\n        nPlus2  = distance_by_element(geometry, lead(geometry, 2))  # distance to pos +30 minutes\n    )\n\nNow we want to calculate the mean distance of nMinus2, nMinus1, nPlus1, nPlus2 for each row. Since we want the mean value per Row, we have to explicitly specify this before mutate() with the function rowwise(). To remove this rowwise-grouping, we end the operation with ungroup().\nNote that for the first two positions, we cannot calculate a stepMean since there is no Position n-2 for these positions. This is also true for the last to positions (lacking a position n+2).\n\nsabi &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        stepMean = mean(c(nMinus2, nMinus1, nPlus1, nPlus2))\n    ) |&gt;\n    ungroup()\n\nsabi\n\nSimple feature collection with 192 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2569724 ymin: 1204916 xmax: 2570927 ymax: 1205957\nProjected CRS: CH1903+ / LV95\n# A tibble: 192 × 12\n   TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC                E        N\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:00:13 2569972. 1205366.\n 2 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:16:06 2569975. 1205637.\n 3 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:30:19 2570266. 1205857.\n 4 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:45:13 2570208. 1205913.\n 5 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:00:10 2570247. 1205731.\n 6 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:15:17 2570512. 1205279.\n 7 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:30:38 2570684. 1205103.\n 8 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:45:16 2570526. 1205051.\n 9 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-07-01 00:00:10 2570532. 1205044.\n10 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-07-01 00:15:14 2570530. 1205059.\n# ℹ 182 more rows\n# ℹ 6 more variables: geometry &lt;POINT [m]&gt;, nMinus2 &lt;dbl&gt;, nMinus1 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   nPlus1 &lt;dbl&gt;, nPlus2 &lt;dbl&gt;, stepMean &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nStep c): Remove “static points”\nWe can now determine if an animal is moving or not by specifying a threshold distance on stepMean. In our example, we use the mean value as a threshold: Positions with distances below this value are considered static.\n\nsabi &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    mutate(static = stepMean &lt; mean(stepMean, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nsabi_filter &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    filter(!static)\n\nsabi_filter |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(E, N)) +\n    geom_path() +\n    geom_point() +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nThe trajectory of sabi, filtered to the positions where the animal was not static\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreperation\nWith the skills from the input above you can now implement the segmentation algorithm described in Laube and Purves (2011) to your own movement data. Export your data from your provider and import is as a data.frame in R.\nAs before, we will calculate the euclidean distance “by hand”. Complete the following preparations in order to start the calculations:\n\nWe need the coordinates of our locations stored in a Projected CRS. Check in which coordinate reference system your data is stored and if necessairy transform it to EPSG 2056 with the function st_transform, as we explained in the first week. You have already done this in week 2.\nTo be able to compute Euclidean distances by hand, we need the coordinates stored in separate columns. The function st_coordinates extracts the coordinates from our sf object. We can bind these coordinates back to our sf object using cbind.\nExplore your data and choose a single day for the next steps.\n\nOnce you have completed this prepartions, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. Before committing, make sure your location data is ignored! Then, test your connection to Github by pushing your changes to your remote repository.\n\n\nTask 1: Segmentation\nNow, you can implement steps a) and b), which you had used with sabi, on on your own movement data. Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message and test your connection to Github by pushing your changes to your remote repository.\n\n\nTask 2: Specify and apply threshold d\nAfter calculating the Euclidean distances to positions within the temporal window v in task 1, you can explore these values (we stored them in the column stepMean) using summary statistics (histograms, boxplot, summary()): This way we can define a reasonable threshold value to differentiate between stops and moves. There is no “correct” way of doing this, specifying a threshold always depends on data as well as the question that needs to be answered. In this exercise, use the mean of all stepMean values.\nStore the new information (boolean to differentiate between stops (TRUE) and moves (FALSE)) in a new column named static.\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 3: Visualize segmented trajectories\nNow visualize the segmented trajectory spatially. Just like last week, you can use ggplot with geom_path(), geom_point() and coord_equal(). Assign colour = static within aes() to distinguish between segments with “movement” and without.\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 4: Segment-based analysis\nIn applying Laube and Purves (2011), we’ve come as far as step b) in Figure 15.1. In order to complete the last steps (c and d), we need a unique ID for each segment that we can use as a grouping variable. The following function does just that (it assigns unique IDs based on the column static which you created in Task 2). You will learn about functions next week. For now, just copy the following code chunk into your script and run it.\n\nrle_id &lt;- function(vec) {\n    x &lt;- rle(vec)$lengths\n    as.factor(rep(seq_along(x), times = x))\n}\n\nYou can use the newly created function rle_id to assign unique IDs to subtrajectories (as shown below). Visualize the moving segments by colourizing them by segment_ID. Then use segment_ID as a grouping variable to determine the segments duration and remove short segments (e.g. segments with a duration &lt; 5 Minutes)\n\nyour_data_frame &lt;- your_data_frame |&gt;\n    mutate(segment_id = rle_id(static))\n\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 5: Similarity measures\nWe will now calculate similarties between trajectories using a new dataset pedestrian.csv. Download an import this dataset as a data.frame or tibble. It it a set of six different but similar trajectories from pedestrians walking on a path.\nFor this task, explore the trajectories first and get an idea on how the pedestrians moved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 6: Calculate similarity\nInstall the package SimilarityMeasures (install.packages(\"SimilarityMeasures\")). Familiarize yourself with this package by skimming through the function descriptions help(package = \"SimilarityMeasures\"). Now compare trajectory 1 to trajectories 2-6 using different similarity measures from the package. Your options are. DTW, EditDist, Frechet and LCSS.\nBefore visualizing your results think about the following: Which two trajectories to you percieve to be most similar, which are most dissimilar? Now visualize the results from the computed similarity measures. Which measure reflects your own intuition the closest?\nNote:\n\nAll functions in the package need matrices as input, with one trajectory per matrix.\nLCSStakes very long to compute. The accuracy of the algorithm (pointSpacing = ,pointDistance = and errorMarg =) can be varied to provide faster calculations. Please see Vlachos, Gunopoulos, and Kollios (2002) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message. Now push all your changes to Github.\n\n\n\n\nLaube, Patrick, and Ross S. Purves. 2011. “How Fast Is a Cow?

    "text": "Open your RStudio Project which you prepared from this week. Create a new RScript and import the libraries we need for this week. Import your wild boar dataset wildschwein_BE_2056.csv as an sf object\n\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"terra\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(\"lubridate\")\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"tmap\")\n\nwildschwein_BE &lt;- read_delim(\"datasets/wildschwein_BE_2056.csv\", \",\") |&gt;\n    st_as_sf(coords = c(\"E\", \"N\"), crs = 2056, remove = FALSE)\n\nDownload the dataset Feldaufnahmen_Fanel.gpkg and save it to your project folder. This is a vector dataset stored in the filetype Geopackage, which is similar to a Shapefile, with some advantages (see the website shapefile must die).\nAlso download the dataset vegetationshoehe_LFI.tif. This is a “raster” dataset stored in a Geotiff, similar to the map we imported in week 1. Also store this file in your project folder and commit these to your repo.\n\nTasks 1: Import and visualize spatial data\nSince Feldaufnahmen_Fanel.gpkg is a vector dataset, you can import it using read_sf(). Explore this dataset in R to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat information does the dataset contain?\nWhat is the geometry type of the dataset (possible types are: Point, Lines and Polygons)?\nWhat are the data types of the other columns?\nWhat is the coordinate system of the dataset?\n\n\n\nTask 2: Annotate Trajectories from vector data\nWe would like to know what crop was visited by which wild boar, and at what time. Since the crop data is most relevant in summer, filter your wild boar data to the months may to june first and save the output to a new variable. Overlay the filtered dataset with your fanel data to verify the spatial overlap.\nTo sematically annotate each wild boar location with crop information, you can use a spatial join with the function st_join(). Do this and explore your annotated dataset.\n\n\nTask 3: Explore annotated trajectories\nThink of ways you could visually explore the spatio-temporal patterns of wild boar in relation to the crops. In our example below we visualize the percentage of samples in a given crop per hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Import and visualize vegetationindex (raster data)\nYou have already downloaded the dataset vegetationshoehe_LFI.tif. Import this dataset\nIn terms of raster data, we have prepared the Vegetation Height Model provided by the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). This dataset contains high resolution information (1x1 Meter) on the vegetation height, which is determined from the difference between the digital surface models DSM and the digital terrain model by swisstopo (swissAlti3D). Buildings are eliminated using a combination of the ground areas of the swisstopo topographic landscape model (TLM) and spectral information from the stereo aerial photos.\nImport the dataset just like you imported the raster map in week 1 (using terra::rast()). Visualize the raster data using tmap (ggplot is very slow with raster data).\n\n\nTask 5: Annotate Trajectories from raster data\nSemantically annotate your wild boar locations with the vegetation index (similar as you did with the crop data in Task 2). Since you are annotating a vector dataset with information from a raster dataset, you cannot use st_join but need the function extract from the terra package. Read the help on the extract function to see what the function expects. The output should look something like this:\nYou can now explore the spatiotemporal patterns of this new data.\n\n\nSubmission\nTo submit your exercise, provide us with the URL of your Github repo as described in the preperation.",
