## Exercise A {#sec-week2-ex-a}

- Create a new RStudio Project for this exercise (see @sec-create-rstudio-project)
- Download the new wild boar movement data, and save it to your new project's directory [wildschwein_BE_2056.csv](https://moodle.zhaw.ch/mod/folder/view.php?id=1192125)

### Task 1: Import your data {#sec-w2a-task1}

Create a new R-file and import the wild boar data.

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week2/exercise_a/task_1.R"
#| echo: true
#| results: "hide"
#| eval: true

```

Note: 

- that this dataset is already converted to EPSG 2056
- the coordinates are stored in the columns (`E`/`N`)

### Task 2: Getting an overview {#sec-w2a-task2}

Calculate the time difference between subsequent rows as described in the demo. You can calculate the time difference using the function `difftime_secs()` (see below) in combination with `lead()` (see @sec-lead-lag). Store the time difference in a new column (e.g. `timelag`). 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false
difftime_secs <- function(later, now){
    as.numeric(difftime(later, now, units = "secs"))
}
```

Now inspect your data in more detail. Try to answer the following questions:

- How many individuals were tracked? 
- For how long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?
- Were all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially? 
- What is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?

::: {.callout-important}
`summarise()` tries to coerce all (Point-) geometries into one object, which can take along time. To avoid this, use `st_drop_geometry()` before using `summarise()`. 
:::

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week2/exercise_a/task_2.R"
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| eval: true

```

### Task 3: Distance between locations

Similar to how we calculated the `timelag` between subsequent locations, we can calculate the distance like so:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| output: false
#| code-fold: false

later <- lag(wildschwein_BE$geometry)
now <- wildschwein_BE$geometry

st_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)  # by_element must be set to TRUE
```

However, similar to `difftime()`, the output has a unit which complicates things. Therefore, it's simpler to wrap the output in `as.numeric()`. Let's make a function for this process:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false


distance_by_element <- function(later, now){
  as.numeric(
    st_distance(later, now, by_element = TRUE)
  )
}
```

Use this function to create a new column named `steplength` with the distance between locations.

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week2/exercise_a/task_3.R"
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| eval: true

```

### Task 4: Deriving distance & speed {#sec-w2-task3}

In this task we will derive some additional movement parameters from our trajectories. So far our trajectories only consist of a list of time-stamped spatial locations. First let's calculate the Euclidean distance between subsequent locations using the function `st_distance()` with the option `by_element = TRUE`. Store these values in a new column with the name `steplength`.
Next, you can calculate the animals' speed based on `steplength` and the `timelag` (from the last task).

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week2/exercise_a/task_4.R"
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| eval: true

```

### Task 5: Plausibility Check 

It's important to repeatedly visualize our results, to make sure these are plausible. This is much simpler if we just look at a small sample of our dataset. We can use `slice()` to extract just a couple of rows

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false

wildschwein_sample <- wildschwein_BE |>
  filter(TierName == "Sabi") |> 
  head(100)

```

We can now visualise the sample using tmap with the *view" mode:

:::{#fig-map-sample-1}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false

library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(wildschwein_sample) + 
  tm_dots()
```

By clicking on the dots, we can see what parameters are associated with each sample.

:::

The wild boar move continuously through space, but our samples are discrete points. It would be helpful to at least see the sequence of these samples. We can do this by casting our points to lines. However, we first need to dissolve our single points into a `MULTIPOINT` object, just like we had to do in the first week when we calculated the minimum convex polygon per animal (see @sec-convex-hull). The option `do_union = FALSE` is a confusing way to preserve the order of the points, see [Nils' question on GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/692).

In addition, we can set `OpenStreetMap` to be the default basemap, since it's available at lower zoom levels.

:::{#fig-map-sample-2}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false

wildschwein_sample_line <- wildschwein_sample |> 
  # dissolve to a MULTIPOINT:
  summarise(do_union = FALSE) |> 
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

tmap_options(basemaps = "OpenStreetMap")

tm_shape(wildschwein_sample_line) +
  tm_lines() +
  tm_shape(wildschwein_sample) + 
  tm_dots()

```

The interconnecting lines help us understand the animal's movement trajectory.
