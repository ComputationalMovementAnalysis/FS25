## Tasks and inputs


### Task 1: Write your own functions

Create the following two functions:

1. A function which calculates a persons BMI based on their height and weight (@eq-bmi)
2. A function which converts degrees Celcius to Farenheight (@eq-temperature)
3. A function which calculates the (Euclidean) distance between two sets of coordinates ($x_1$, $y_1$ and $x_2$, $y_2$), see @eq-euclidean


$$
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
$$ {#eq-bmi}

$$
\text{Farenheight} = \text{Celcius} \times \frac{9}{5} + 32
$$ {#eq-temperature}


$$
\text{Euclidean distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2+(y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$ {#eq-euclidean}


### Task 2: Prepare Analysis

In the next tasks we will look for "meet" patterns in our wild boar data. To simplify this, we will only use a subset of our wild boar data: The individuals *Rosa* and *Sabi* for the timespan *01.04.2015 - 15.04.2015*. Use the dataset `wildschwein_BE_2056.csv` (on moodle). Import the csv as a data.frame and filter it with the aforementioned criteria. You do not need to convert the data.frame to an `sf` object. 



```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week5/task_2.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 3: Create Join Key

Have a look at your dataset. You will notice that samples are taken at every full hour, quarter past, half past and quarter to. The sampling time is usually off by a couple of seconds. 

To compare Rosa and Sabi's locations, we first need to match the two animals *temporally*. For that we can use a `join`, but need *identical* time stamps to serve as a join key. We therefore need to slightly adjust our time stamps to a common, concurrent interval. 

The task is therfore to round the minutes of `DatetimeUTC` to a multiple of 15 (00, 15, 30,45) and store the values in a new column[^interpolate]. You can use the  `lubridate` function `round_date()` for this. See the examples [here](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/round_date.html) to see how this goes.

[^interpolate]: *Please note:* We are manipulating our time stamps without adjusting the x,y-coordinates. This is fine for our simple example, but we would advice against this in a more serious research endeavour, e.g. in your semester projects. One simple approach would be to linearly interpolate the positions to the new timestamps. If you choose Option A the wild boar projects as your semester projects, you should aim for a linear interpolation. Get in touch if you need help with this.

Your new dataset should look something like this (note the additional column): 

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week5/task_3.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 4: Measuring distance at concurrent locations

To measure the distance between concurrent locations, we need to follow the following steps.

1. Split the `wildschwein_filter` object into one `data.frame` per animal
2. Join[^join] these datasets by the new `Datetime` column created in the last task. The joined observations are *temporally close*.
3. In the joined dataset, calculate Euclidean distances between concurrent observations and store the values in a new column
4. Use a reasonable threshold on `distance` to determine if the animals are also *spatially close* enough to constitute a *meet* (we use 100 meters). Store this Boolean information (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) in a new column

[^join]: We recommend using one `dplyr`s join methods (`inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()` or `full_join()`), which one is appropriate? Tip: specify `suffix` to prevent column names ending in `.x` or `.y`.

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week5/task_4.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 5: Visualize data

Now, visualize the *meets* spatially in a way that you think reasonable. For example in the plot as shows below. To produce this plot we:

- Used the individual dataframes from `rosa` and `sabi` (from the previous task)
- Used the joined dataset (also from the previous task), filtered to only the meets
- Manually changed the x and y axis limits

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week5/task_5.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 6 (optional): Visualize data as timecube with `plotly`

Finally, you can nicely visualize the meeting patterns and trajectories in a Space-Time-Cube [@hagerstraand1970] with the package `plotly`. There are some [nice ressources](https://plot.ly/r/3d-line-plots/) available online.

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week5/task_6.R"
#| echo: false
#| include: false

```


### Submission

To submit your exercise, provide us with the URL of the rendered quarto document (e.g. on [QuartoPub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html), [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)) on moodle, as you did last week.

## If you use GitHub...

You can give other GitHub users write access to your repository throught the repository settings. You might want to use this this for your semester project. To practice this, add Evelyn ([\@DLND8](https://github.com/terzev/)) and Nils ([\@ratnanil](https://github.com/ratnanil/)) to your GitHub repo: 

1. Go to your GitHub repository on GitHub.com
2. Go to the repository settings by clicking on the *Settings* tab
3. In the left panel, click on *Collaborators and teams* and then *Add people*
4. Add the mentioned Persons via their GitHub Usernames, give them *Write* privileges.
